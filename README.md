# Wordle Clone

This is a simple clone of Wordle that I made for a practice project. The rules are the same as for normal Wordle: 

- Each guess is five letters long
- You can make up to six guesses
- The guesses have to be real words from the word list
- The tile will turn green if that letter is in the correct spot, yellow if it's in an incorrect spot, or gray if it's not in the word

I have included a different version of the normal statistics since my project allows endless play. The stats cover how many times you have played, how many of those plays have been wins, and the average number of guess attempts you've made. There is also a button for resetting the stats. I have also included a toggleable display of the correct answer for testing purposes.

Have fun!
